# TinyErrands

TinyErrands was developed with the hope of providing easy errands that are paying and offered around you. Getting $5 for bringing somebody's
starbucks, or walking someone's dog or delivering someone else's groceries is what this app hopes to make available for those in need of assistance
and those in need of a quick buck.
